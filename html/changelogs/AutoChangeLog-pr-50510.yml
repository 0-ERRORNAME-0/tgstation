changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added H2 gas"
  - rscadd: "Added H2 gas burn (reaction with o2, similar to tritium but without the radiations)"
  - rscadd: "Added Electrolyzer (machine to make H2, requires power cell, once turned on and with h2o in the air will start converting it to h2 and o2 with the reaction 2H2O -> 2H2 + O2. Upgrading the parts will increase the amount of converted H2O and the efficency of the cell)"
  - rscadd: "Added H2 interaction with SM (similar to trit, less radiation emission, same heat production and a bit of heat protection)"
  - rscadd: "H2 reaction with N2 to make ammonia crystals (reaction in open air to make the crystals, temperatures between 0 °C and - 120° C, more N2 than H2)"
  - rscadd: "H2 reaction with bz as catalyst at high heat and pressure (over 1e6 for both) to make metal hydrogen"
  - rscadd: "metallic hydrogen golem (one of endish atmosian goal)"
  - tweak: "changed fusion to use h2 instead of co2, everything else is still the same"
  - tweak: "plasma burn now produces h2o too (a quarter of the produced co2)"
  - tweak: "H2O vapor now slip under 30 °C so that plasma fires are not hellish"
  - imageadd: "added electrolyzer sprites (reuse of some unused ones)"
  - imageadd: "added ammonia crystals sprites
remove: fusion no longer generate stim and nitryl"
