  - balance: "Macrobomb implants now have a weak explosion radius of 20 (up from 16)."
  - bugfix: "Macrobomb implants will now no longer refuse to implant themselves in someone that already has a macrobomb implant, and instead will add their stats to that existing macrobomb implant, as they would to a microbomb implant."
